# Proposal: Data Science for Scientists ATL 2018-2019

## Goals

This proposal represents the goals of 
[Data Science for Scientists ATL](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Scientists-ATL)
("DataSci4ScienceATL") for the 2018-2019 academic year. 
Our overarching goal for this year is:  
> **work with trainees to develop programs for training in research computing and data science**  

This goal for the 2018-2019 academic year aligns with the group's two main goals:  
1. help scientists acquire scientific computing skills  
2. prepare scientists for data scientist positions in academia and industry.

## Proposed Approach

Our approach to developing training will also achieve two specific goals, which 
we have chosen based on discussion with trainees and faculty over the last year.  
1. provide basic scientific computing **literacy** for *all* life scientists  
2. enable motivated trainees to acquire **expertise** in research computing and data science
that will make them strong candidates for academic and industry positions

These two goals emerged from the following:  
- discussions during the 
[Fall 2017 Academic Learning Community on Data Science](http://cfde.emory.edu/programs/academiclearningcommunities/data-science-research-education-alc.html)
led by 
[Lance Waller (Emory biostatistics)](https://www.sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/#!LWALLER)
and 
[Vaidy Sunderam(Math/Computer Science))](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~vss/)  
- the proposal submitted to the Burroughs Wellcome Fund for 
[Quantitative and Statistical Thinking in the Life Sciences](https://www.bwfund.org/grant-programs/population-sciences-0)
, authored by 
Lance Waller, 
[Vicki Hertzburg (Biostatistics/Bioinformatics)](https://www.sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/#!VHERTZB), and 
[Nael McCarty (director of GDBBS, Marcus professor of Cystic Fibrosis, Pediatrics)](http://www.biomed.emory.edu/about-us/contact-us.html),
 with input and support from 
[Dean Lisa Tedesco](http://www.gs.emory.edu/about/dean.html) of Laney Graduate School  
- [organizational meetings of DataSci4ScienceATL](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Scientists-ATL/meeting-notes)  
- *many* conversations with trainees at [monthly meetings](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Scientists-ATL) of DataSci4ScienceATL  
- conversations with trainess and faculty elsewhere (e.g., executive committee meetings of individual GDBBS programs)  
**Therefore we are confident this proposal reflects both the needs of trainees and the expert vision of faculty.**

We plan three major events this year to achieve the two goals of our approach:  
1. two-day [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) workshop just before the Fall semester  
  - will reach ~360 trainees (3 rooms of 120 people each)  
  - **major step towards providing basic research computing skills to all life science trainees**  
  - DataSci4ScienceATL organizers will also become Software Carpentry instructor trainers, ensuring we have **local experts** that can provide such training  
2. short course during the Fall semester  
  - three sessions of 25 students each  
  - lecture / lab component  
  - students will complete a semester project that will result in tangibles + demonstration of concrete skills  
  - will build on skills acquired in Software Carpentry workshop  
  - again will add to skills of DataSci4ScienceATL organizers by showing they can teach this material  
  - will be based on successful short course held previously  
3. hackathon during the Spring semester  
  - capstone towards which students can build  
  - will bring in experts from academia and industry to judge  

In addition to these three major events, we will also continue regular events of the group:  
1. *methods clinics*: trainees present works in progress for feedback from other group members. Includes brainstorming sessions to solve technical challenges, tutorials to share software libraries and tools, and practice presentations for conferences.  
2. *invited speakers*: speakers share advice and expertise. Speakers include professors and industry professionals.  
3. *open organizational meetings*: group organizers report and plan on group activities and proposal progress. These meetings are open to all members but only the organizers are required to be present.


## Associated timescales and costs

### timescale:
- by end of May:  
 + finish planning most of Software Carpentry workshop  
 + start planning Fall short course  
 + finish planning Summer group events  
- by end of July  
 + finish planning Fall short course  
 + start planning Hackathon  
 + finish planning Fall group events  
- by end of October  
 + finish planning Spring group events  
- by end of December  
 + finish planning hackathon  
 
### costs:
- Software Carpentry training at SciPy conference  
 + per-person registration: $275 * 3  
 + flight / lodging  
 + **this allows us to host local Software Carpentry workshop 
 without costs of bringing other trained instructors to Emory**  
 + **students that stay for entire conference will network with
   core members of international scientific computing community and 
   industry data scientists, and have the 
   opportunity to present (lightning talks/birds of feather sessions)
   and gain experience contributing to open-source software (sprints)**
